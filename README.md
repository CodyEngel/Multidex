# Multidex
The goal with Multidex is to create a Kotlin multiplatform project that shares code across Android,
iOS, Desktop, Web, and JVM. I'm using [PeopleInSpace](https://github.com/joreilly/PeopleInSpace) as
a reference for the Kotlin Multiplatform related work as their gradle setup is really intuitive.

I will not be building every platform simultaneously. Instead I'll be starting with Android and using
Jetpack Compose. As I'm learning how to get the most out of Compose I will also be building out the
common code modules as it makes sense.

## Libraries
TBD -- The hope is this will list out of all the libraries I _actually_ made use of for this project
and how they fell into place.
